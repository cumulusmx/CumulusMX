	- Similar to the existing Select-a-Graph which only show recent 1 minute data, the new charts show data at your logging resolution, but you can select any start and end dates from your historic data.
	- Note: selecting a large date range can be quite slow as the data has to be read from the log files
- You can now regenerate ALL missing NOAA reports from either the Month or Year NOAA screens
	- Note: Unlike the (Re)Generate button, the new option will not overwrite existing report files, it will only create missing ones
- There is a new Latest Errors display in the dashboard - Utils | Latest Errors
	- By default it displays the last 50 Warnings and Errors encountered by CMX, if you are seeing too many warnings that are expected, you can opt to log only errors in Settings | Program Settings | Logging Options
- The Cumulus settings can now be 'secured' with a username/password. NOTE: Because Cumulus does not use HTTPS these credentials can be snooped on the network, the security provided is limited.
	- This feature has required some minor changes to the Cumulus API: wsport.json, version.json, dateformat.txt, and csvseparator.txt have moved to a new path /api/info/
- Add forwarders to Ecowitt Extra Sensors station type
- Add an integrity check to the SQLite database on start-up


Changed
- Internal changes to update the Visual Studio project files from the previous legacy version

3.26.0 - b3248
——————————————
New
- MQTT has a new behaviour - Only update a topic if the data has changed
	- If you add a new property called "doNotTriggerOnTags" to a topic, you can specify a list of web tokens. Adding this property with at least one entry triggers the new behaviour.
	  The web tokens in the list are excluded from the comparison process, so for instance if you include a timestamp in your topic, you can exclude this from the change detection.
	  For example:
		{
			"topic": "CumulusMX/TempUpdate",
			"data": "\"time\":\"<#timehhmmss>\",\"temp\":<#temp rc=y>",
			"retain": false,
			"doNotTriggerOnTags": "timehhmmss"
		}
	Which now will only send a new MQTT message when CMX first starts, then only when the "#temp" value changes.
- Adds new alarm for any all-time record being set
- Adds new alarm "Web upload errors" for errors in the FTP/PHP upload processes
- Adds the ability to append free text comments to the wxnow.txt file. You can also include web tags
- New web tag for recent rainfall - <#RecentRain> - it takes the same parameters as the other RecentXxxx web tags, and defaults to today's total if the parameters are incorrect or no recent data is available
- New web tag for Ecowitt sensor radio reception strength - <#EcowittReception>
	- By default it returns a string of comma separated sensor names and value. eg "WH80=4,WH41CH1=3"
	- You can add a parameter "format=json" - <#EcowittReception format=json> - and it will return a valid JSON string. eg. {"WH80":4,"WH41CH1":3}
	- The values are updated every 20 minutes along with the battery info
- The existing web tag <#txbattery> now also supports the format=json parameter which functions the same as #EcowittReception tag above
- New alternative name for the existing web tag <#GW1000FirmwareVersion>, you can now use <#EcowittFirmwareVersion>
- Adds Custom MySQL commands for when Cumulus starts up. These will be executed after the station is initialised, but before it starts any historic catch-up or live processing

——————————————
New
- Extra Files now allows you to use the variables <custinterval1> thru <custinterval10> in the source and destination fields to specify custom log files to be uploaded/copied
- Copy/Upload Now! gets a new option to transfer the latest NOAA monthly/year reports

Changed
- Copy/Upload Now! the upload of full rather than incremental versions of graph data files is now optional

Fixed
- Davis VP2 logger suppression of full logger downloads if CMX is stopped and immediately restarted fractionally after a logging interval
- Extra Files with EOD flag having "tmp" appended to all source files
- Not running as a 64 bit application on Windows
- NOAA report PHP uploads were no using the UTF8 flag
- Davis WLL using "stale" current wind gust data
- Daily graphs not being uploaded/copied after day reset


3.24.1 - b3234
——————————————
New
- Implements the dashboard time format override - just on the Dashboard and Today/Yesterday screens for now
	- Configure in Program settings | Culture Over-rides
- Adds Station Pressure support for Ecowitt API, Ecowitt HTTP, Ambient HTTP, and EasyWeather stations

	<#presstrendsigned>
	<#temptrendsigned>
- A new web tag for the station pressure (the absolute pressure reading) <#stationpressure>
- The data visibility has been changed from a simple off/on to a tri-state. You can now select between Off|Visible|Dashboard Only
	- Visible means the data will be shown on both the local dash and the default web site
	- Dashboard Only means the data can only be viewed on the CMX local interface.
		You may wish to use this to hide sensitive data like indoor temperatures on the public web site which can indicate if you are home or not
	- Any data previous flagged as Visible, will migrate to the new Visible state
- Extra Sensor graph data can now be sent to the default web site
- You can now send an additional four extra temperature readings to Weather Underground
- New PHP upload alternative to FTP/SFTP
	- This uses a secure PHP script on your web server to upload the data rather than using an FTP service
	- The graph recent data files are sent incrementally using this mechanism, cutting bandwidth usage
		- On starting CMX a full copy of each data file is sent
		- Thereafter only the new data for the interval is sent, and the PHP upload script appends this to the existing file, and trims out old data
- The generation of local copies of the data files is now optional
	- You can deselect the "Generate" option if you do not require a file to be written to the CMX folders. This will reduce disk I/O, a concern for rPi users with SD cards

- Tempest station now forces the UDP listening port to be opened in shared mode
- The "Stop second instance" option has been rewritten. It now only prevents two instances *using the same port* from running
	- This change means for it to work ALL running instances must be v3.24.0 or later
- Alarm email sends are now retried twice on failure

Fixed
- Adds missing Wind Chill from the historic graphs on the dashboard and default web site
- Now ignores AirLink zero values when the percent in last hour is also zero. This occurs during a restart of AirLink

- Davis WLL now fully falls back to the local API current conditions for rain and wind data if broadcasts stop being received for 30 seconds
	- There is now a new Advanced setting for the WLL: Trigger DataStopped on Broadcast stop
		Previously if broadcasts stopped being received, a full DataStopped condition and alarm was triggered
		Now CMX falls back to using the local API for all data
		This new configuration setting allows you to set the DataStopped only when both broadcasts AND local API responses stop being received

Fixed
- Extra sensor graphs stopping at month end
- Start-up/rollover backups were copying Custom logs to the CMX root folder rather than the backup folder
- Davis WLL not updating the gust value if broadcast data stops being received

		Pressure   : hPa | mb | kPa | inHg
		Wind       : mph | kph | ms | kt
		Rainfall   : mm | in
		Wind run   : km | mi | Nm
	You may also need to override the number of decimal places when converting.
	For example, when converting native mb or hPa to kPa or inHg, you would also need to add "dp=2"
		<#press unit=kPa dp=2>

- New: Adds Lightning distance and last strike time to Today.ini to preserve the values across CMX runs when the GW-1000 has 'forgotten' them
	[Lightning]
	Distance=-1
	LastStrike=0001-01-01T00:00:00
- New: Adds a global Enable/Disable switch to Internet FTP settings, the value for this on the first run of this version of CMX will be inferred from the other settings.
	From this release onwards, this switch can be used to enable/disable all FTP activity. It does not affect the Interval and real time interval settings.
	Disabling this option also disables all the relevant FTP settings in the following sub-sections on the page
- New: Adds an option to Internet settings for "Local Copy". This enables the ability to create all the standard web site files, and copy them on the local file
	system instead (or as well as) FTPing them. Useful for installs that run on the same host as the web server.
- New: Two new web tags for sunshine hours
	<#SunshineHoursMonth> <#SunshineHoursYear>
	- When used without parameters these return the total sunshine hours for this month so far, and this year so far.
	- The Month tag accepts three parameters:
		y=nnnn & m=nn - use these to specify a specific month you want the total for. Example - <#SunshineHoursMonth y=2021 m=1> for the January 2021 total
		r=-nn - use this parameter to specify a relative month, -1 = last month, -2 = month before last etc. Example <#SunshineHoursMonth r=-1> for last month's total
	- The Year tag accepts two parameters:
		y=nnnn - specify the year you want the total. Example <#SunshineHoursYear y=2020>
		r=-nn - specify a relative year, -1 = last year etc. Example <#SunshineHoursYear r=-2> total for the year before last
	- The tags also accept the usual rc=y and dp=n parameters

- New: Catch-up from a station logger with (standard) MySQL enabled, now also adds each archive entry to the Realtime table
- New: Adds the ability to buffer failed MySQL commands until the MySQL server becomes available again, or Cumulus MX is restarted - when they will be lost
	- Enabled via an option in MySQL Settings
	- Note: Whilst Realtime updates are buffered, the uploading of failed queries is only performed by the Log updates
- New: FineOffset stations now log the progress of archive data loading to the console
- New: NOAA Reports now have an option to calculate the mean temperatures using the traditional method (max + min) / 2
	- Note: This does not apply to heating/cooling degree days, they will still use the integrated method
- New: Adds ET for Davis WLL stations with Pro subscriptions
	- Note: Your solar sensor MUST be connected to your primary ISS for this to work, otherwise weatherlink.com does not calculate ET


- Change: Cumulus MX now uses a persistent database to store the recent 1 minute data
	- This means that charts, recent webtags, and internal calculations for trends and periodic values will be more accurate after a restart
	- If Cumulus MX is offline for a prolonged period, data for that offline period will obviously still be at the station logging interval resolution
- Change: MQTT now allows multiple topics for both Update and Interval data.
	- The format of the MQTT template files has changed to accommodate this
	- The template must now be formatted as JSON, however the payload data for each topic can still be in whatever format you like so long as you construct
	  a valid string - i.e. escape quotation marks
	- The default interval template (the update template is similar) now looks like this...
		{"topics": [
			{
				"topic": "CumulusMX/Interval",
				"data": "{\"time\":\"<#timehhmmss>\",\"temp\":<#temp rc=y>,\"humidity\":<#hum>,\"wgust\":<#wgust rc=y>}",
				"retain": false
			}
		]}
		Where the topic name is "CumulusMX/Interval", and the payload is the string "{\"time\":\"<#timehhmmss>\",\"te...rc=y>}" which is formatted as JSON text
	- To create a template with multiple topics, use this format...
		{"topics": [
			{"topic": "MyName/Topic1", "data": "\"<#timehhmmss>\",<#temp rc=y>", "retain": false},
			{"topic": "MyName/Topic2", "data": "<data><humidity><val><#hum></val></humidity></data>", "retain": true}
		]}
		Where Topic1 is formatted as CSV and is not retained on the server, and Topic2 as XML and is retained
	- The Dashboard Internet > MQTT settings have been updated to reflect these changes

- Change: The Dashboard settings pages now load the forms JSON as static files rather than via the API.
- Change: The console output on start-up has been changed slightly to show actual IP addresses in URLs, and I have added some colour.
	- You now also get different messages if no Cumulus.ini file is detected, directing users to run the first time setup wizard
- Change: The default web site NOAA reports page is now accessible and removes the mouse-over month selection
- Change: When configuring the Davis WLL station, if any extra sensors are enabled, then Extra Logging is also automatically enabled.
- Change: Default unit values for new installs changed for Wind, Pressure and Altitude...
	m/s -> km/h
	mbar -> hPa
	feet -> metres
- Change: When reading the Cumulus.ini file at start-up, if settings are migrated, or invalid entries corrected, Cumulus.ini is now re-written.
	That is re-written as created afresh, not updated in place. Old entries are removed, and the file order resequenced. Thus you cannot then
	use the new Cumulus.ini on old versions of Cumulus, you will have to use backups.
- Change: Cosmetic changes to most Settings pages, and Records editors
- Change: Some libraries updated:
	- Email:	MailKit
	- MQTT:		MQTTnet
	- MySQL:	MySqlConnector
	- JSON:		ServiceStack.Text

	- Extra Sensor Settings
	- Calibration Settings
	- NOAA Settings
	- MySQL Settings

	  This defaults to 1, so the alarm will trigger immediately. If set to 5, then it will take 5 trigger events happen within the Latch time to set the alarm.
	  The idea is to prevent an occasional error from triggering the alarm
	  Cumulus.ini settings:
		[Alarms]
		SpikeAlarmTriggerCount=1
		HttpUploadAlarmTriggerCount=1
		MySqlUploadAlarmTriggerCount=1
- New: Web tags - <#HttpUploadAlarm>, <#MySqlUploadAlarm>

	Note: These settings still remain in the [Station] section of the Cumulus.ini file for backwards compatibility
- New: Two settings to delay the start-up of Cumulus MX. Both added to the new Program Settings page.
	Start-up Host PING:        Specify a remote hostname or IP address, Cumulus will wait for a successful PING from this address before continuing
	Start-up Delay:            Specify a fixed time in seconds to delay the start-up. The delay will be executed after the PING check is one is specified
	Start-up Delay Max Uptime: Specify a maximum system uptime in seconds after which the delay will no longer be applied. Set to zero to always delay
	New section in Cumulus.ini:
	[Program]
	StartupPingHost=            // Default is no remote host - enter a host name or IP address
	StartupDelaySecs=0          // Default is no delay = 0
	StartupDelayMaxUptime=300   // Default is 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- New: FTP Now - Adds a new option to regenerate the daily graph data files (if enabled), and include them in the manually invoked FTP session
- New: Adds support for OpenWeatherMap uploads (and catch-up). Using an existing station if the id is supplied, or your API key only has one station defined.
	If no stations are defined CMX automatically creates a new one using your station details and starts uploading to it.



3.9.3 - b3098
—————————————

- Adds Notifications to Alarms
	Note: Cumulus notifications only work by default if you run the browser on the same machine as Cumulus and connect using the
	url: http://localhost:8998
	In order to get them working on a remote machine you will have to change an advanced flag in your browser.
	This is at your own risk as advanced flags are unsupported features in Chrome and Edge.
	In Chrome or Edge, open the url - "about:flags"
	Find the entry "Insecure origins treated as secure" and enable it
	The add the url you use to remotely access the Cumulus dashboard - eg. http://192.168.1.23:8998
	Then click the button to restart your browser. Notifications should now work.
- Adds Latch times to Alarms. You can now specify a period in hours that an alarm will remain active after the event that tripped it has reset.
- The default value for "DavisIncrementPressureDP" is changed from true to false
  ** The effect of this is that for Davis VP/VP2 stations, the default number of decimal places used for pressure values changes
     from 2 dp (hPa/mb) and 3 dp (kPa, inHg) to 1 dp (hPa/mb) and 2 dp (kPa, inHg)
  ** If you wish to retain the previous behaviour, then you MUST add the setting "DavisIncrementPressureDP=1" to your Cumulus.ini file

- Fix: Crash on start-up on the 1st of the month between 00:00 and rollover hour when using 9am rollover
- Fix: AWEKAS Sunshine hours were being truncated to integer hours
- New feature: Cumulus MX now supports running as a system service
	- When running as a service the normal console output is logged to a file: \MXdiags\ServiceConsoleLog.txt
	- On Windows
		- To set Cumulus up as a service run it as an Administrator using the command line parameter -install
		- To remove the Cumulus system service run it as an Administrator using the command line parameter -uninstall
		- The service will stop itself if it detects that the computer is going into standby
		- To add parameters to the service when it starts automatically you will have to edit the registry
			HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\CumulusMX\ImagePath
			Add the parameters after the quoted executable string. Eg.
				"C:\CumulusMX\CumulusMX.exe" -port 9000
		- The service can be stopped/started using the usual utilities:
			The Services applet:- services.msc (You can pass parameters using this tool, but they are not saved for future use)
			The service command line tool:- sc start|stop|query CumulusMX [optional parameters for start-up here]
	- On Linux
		- Run Cumulus using the mono-service command instead of mono. You also need to add the command line parameter -service
		  > mono-service -l:/var/run/cmx.pid CumulusMX.exe -service                              (if pathed to CumulusMX folder)
		 or
		  > mono-service -l:/var/run/cmx.pid -d:<</path/to/cumulusmx>> CumulusMX.exe -service    (from any location)
		- To stop the service you use kill, which will perform an orderly shutdown of MX
		  > kill `cat /var/run/cmx.pid`
- New feature:
	- When running on Linux there is now an init.d script to start/stop the service.
	- The script can be found in the \MXutils\linux folder
		- Copy it to your /etc/init.d folder
		- Change the permissions to 0755
		  > chmod 0755 /etc/init.d/cumulusmx.sh
	- The script supports the following commands: start, stop, restart, status, removelock
		- start: Starts MX as a service and creates a lock file to prevent it running again
		- stop: Stops MX as a service and removes the lock file
		- restart: Stops, then starts MX
		- status: Reports if MX is running (only by checking the lock file at present), and dumps the latest console output to screen
		- removelock: Removes a stray lock file if one gets left behind
	- The command line would be: /etc/init.d/cumulusmx.sh start|stop|restart|status|removelock
	- Script name: \MXutils\linux\cumulusmx.sh
- New feature:
	- When running on Windows as a service, the service will stop if the computer goes to standby/hibernate mode. A script to set up
		a Scheduled Task that will restart the service on resume from standby/hibernate is provided in the \MXutils\windows folder.
		The script MUST be run with Administrator privileges.
	- Script name: \MXutils\windows\CreateCmxResumeFromStandbyTask.ps1

3.7.0 - b3089
—————————————
- Fix: Humidex was treated by MX as a temperature and incorrectly converted using the Celsius to Fahrenheit
  conversion (if that was the user selected temperature unit).
  Humidex is a dimensionless scale that should not be converted to retain meaning

- Fix: Real time SFTP not recovering from some reconnection situations
- Fix: Add missing "rc" function from <#battery> web tag
- Fix: Remove units from Humidex value on the chart tooltip

- Updated files
	\CumulusMX.exe
	\FluentFTP.dll



3047
————
- Web token parser updated to cope with html tag characters "<>" in the format string.
	- You can now do things like...
		<#TapptempH format="dd'&nbsp;'MMM'&nbsp;'yyyy'<span class=\'xx\'> at 'HH:mm'</span>'">
		which gives...
		04&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;2018<span class='xx'> at 10:12</span>

		Note: that you have to use single quotes for HTML entity names, and they have to be escaped "\'"

- New Davis Baud Rate setting
	- Allows you to alter the speed of the serial connection to Davis loggers
	- Configured manually in Cumulus.ini [Station] section
		DavisBaudRate=19200 (default) Permitted values are 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200

- Added new option for the "Extra files" - End of Day
	- Enabling this means that file will only be processed/copied/FTPed once a day during the end of day roll-over.
	- There is a new Cumulus.ini file setting for each "extra" file associated with this setting
		ExtraEOD[nn]
	- Note there is currently no check between Realtime and End of Day settings, you could check both options and the file
	  will be processed at both the realtime interval AND end of day - which would not make much sense!

- Improvement to Instromet logger protocol handling

- Change the Fine Offset Synchronised Reads option to default to enabled

- Change VP2 automatic disabling of LOOP2 to an advisory message, as the firmware version is not always detected.

- Consistency: All record Value tags should now return '---' and Date tags '----' until they are first set.

- Removed files
	\fastJSON.dll



3046
————

	- Added <#snowdepth> tag processing

- ET annual roll-over fix

- Fix to TLS 1.2 FTPS of the 'periodic' files



3045
————

- Astro calcs for Solar
	- Added refraction correction.
	- updated to add some extra terms.

- Removed URL encode Twitter messages added in b3044

- Added second order humidity correction factor, works the same as the temperature. It has to be set manually in Cumulus.ini.
	- Cumulus.ini
		[Offsets]
		HumMult2=0.0

- FTP Updates
	- Now supports FTPS over TLS1.1 and 1.2
	- In Passive FTP, you can disable Enhanced Passive (EPSV) mode if it causes problems with your host. Some hosts are reporting they support it, but a firewall along the route cannot handle the connections.
	  Requires manually adding a new Cumulus.ini entry...
		[FTP site]
		DisableEPSV=1
	- RealtimeGaugesTxt is no longer automatically enabled for FTP.

- Web Sockets are no longer on a separate port, it shares the same port as HTTP.
	- The wsport command line switch is still recognised for backwards compatibility, but it is no longer used.

- Fix Fine Offset with solar logger reading, now limited to the reduced number of logger entries available on solar stations.

- Fix for Slovenian locale (and any other with a two character date separator)



3044
————
- Added new solar calculation method "Bras"
	- New Cumulus.ini entries...
		SolarCalc=0    		(0=Ryan-Stolzenbach, 1=Bras, default=0)
		BrasTurbidity=2   	(atmospheric turbidity factor (2=clear, 5=smoggy, default=2)
	- Updated the Interface web files to reflect the new settings.

- Updated HidSharp to ver 2.0.5
	- Now uses libudev1 for Fine Offset and WMR200 stations

- Fixed corrupt/missing MySQL port causing CumulusMX to crash on start-up

- Attempt to reconnect to Davis IP logger on connection failure (only a possible fix)

- Updated the default forum URL to it's new home

- Updated included website files to new URL

- URL encode Twitter messages (I know Twitter is largely broken)

- Davis VP2 - (Steve Loft) Added sanity checks for invalid wind speed/direction values

- Davis VP2 - Added automatic disabling of the use of LOOP2 packets on firmware versions < 1.90

- Change RG11 devices to use a new Cumulus.ini file entry. The previous MX builds would not work on Linux.
  For example:
	RG11port=2   (depreciated)
	RG11port2=3
		now use
	RG11portName=COM2   (for Windows or /dev/ttyUSB2 for Linux)
	RG11portName2=COM3   (for Windows or /dev/ttyUSB3 for Linux)

- The default Comm port values are now set to either COM1 or /dev/ttyUSB0 depending on the platform. Hopefully this will prevent some of the confusion of new users.
