	Start-up Host PING:        Specify a remote hostname or IP address, Cumulus will wait for a successful PING from this address before continuing
	Start-up Delay:            Specify a fixed time in seconds to delay the start-up. The delay will be executed after the PING check is one is specified
	Start-up Delay Max Uptime: Specify a maximum system uptime in seconds after which the delay will no longer be applied. Set to zero to always delay
	New section in Cumulus.ini:
	[Program]
	StartupPingHost=            // Default is no remote host - enter a host name or IP address

- Adds Notifications to Alarms
	Note: Cumulus notifications only work by default if you run the browser on the same machine as Cumulus and connect using the
	url: http://localhost:8998
	In order to get them working on a remote machine you will have to change an advanced flag in your browser.
	This is at your own risk as advanced flags are unsupported features in Chrome and Edge.
	In Chrome or Edge, open the url - "about:flags"
	Find the entry "Insecure origins treated as secure" and enable it
	The add the url you use to remotely access the Cumulus dashboard - eg. http://192.168.1.23:8998

- Adds Latch times to Alarms. You can now specify a period in hours that an alarm will remain active after the event that tripped it has reset.
- The default value for "DavisIncrementPressureDP" is changed from true to false
  ** The effect of this is that for Davis VP/VP2 stations, the default number of decimal places used for pressure values changes
     from 2 dp (hPa/mb) and 3 dp (kPa, inHg) to 1 dp (hPa/mb) and 2 dp (kPa, inHg)
  ** If you wish to retain the previous behaviour, then you MUST add the setting "DavisIncrementPressureDP=1" to your Cumulus.ini file

	- New web tags <#CO2>, <#CO2-24h>
- Adds new Linux cumulusmx.service configuration file (thanks to @freddie), this allows you run Cumulus MX as a service under Linux using the
  newer systemd control rather than the original init.d script supplied with v3.8.0
	- Edit the cumulusmx.service configuration file and change the path to match your Cumulus MX installation folder
	- Copy cumulusmx.service to your /etc/systemd/system/ folder
	- Cumulus can then be started and stopped with the following commands:
		> systemctl start cumulusmx
		> systemctl stop cumulusmx
	- Status and restart are available too:
		> systemctl restart cumulusmx
		> systemctl status cumulusmx
	- If you make a change to the unit file, you need to run the following command so that systemd re-reads your file:
		> systemctl daemon-reload
	- To have Cumulus start on reboot, issue the following command:
		> systemctl enable cumulusmx
	- Finally, to stop the service running on reboot, use the following:
		> systemctl disable cumulusmx

- Fix: Malformed API JSON returned by api/tags/process.json if no data output is generated
- Fix: Crash on start-up on the 1st of the month between 00:00 and rollover hour when using 9am rollover
- Fix: AWEKAS Sunshine hours were being truncated to integer hours
- New feature: Cumulus MX now supports running as a system service
	- When running as a service the normal console output is logged to a file: \MXdiags\ServiceConsoleLog.txt
	- On Windows
		- To set Cumulus up as a service run it as an Administrator using the command line parameter -install
		- To remove the Cumulus system service run it as an Administrator using the command line parameter -uninstall
		- The service will stop itself if it detects that the computer is going into standby
		- To add parameters to the service when it starts automatically you will have to edit the registry
			HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\CumulusMX\ImagePath
			Add the parameters after the quoted executable string. Eg.
				"C:\CumulusMX\CumulusMX.exe" -port 9000
		- The service can be stopped/started using the usual utilities:
			The Services applet:- services.msc (You can pass parameters using this tool, but they are not saved for future use)
			The service command line tool:- sc start|stop|query CumulusMX [optional parameters for start-up here]
	- On Linux
		- Run Cumulus using the mono-service command instead of mono. You also need to add the command line parameter -service
		  > mono-service -l:/var/run/cmx.pid CumulusMX.exe -service                              (if pathed to CumulusMX folder)
		 or
		  > mono-service -l:/var/run/cmx.pid -d:<</path/to/cumulusmx>> CumulusMX.exe -service    (from any location)
		- To stop the service you use kill, which will perform an orderly shutdown of MX
		  > kill `cat /var/run/cmx.pid`
- New feature:
	- When running on Linux there is now an init.d script to start/stop the service.
	- The script can be found in the \MXutils\linux folder
		- Copy it to your /etc/init.d folder
		- Change the permissions to 0755
		  > chmod 0755 /etc/init.d/cumulusmx.sh
	- The script supports the following commands: start, stop, restart, status, removelock
		- start: Starts MX as a service and creates a lock file to prevent it running again
		- stop: Stops MX as a service and removes the lock file
		- restart: Stops, then starts MX
		- status: Reports if MX is running (only by checking the lock file at present), and dumps the latest console output to screen
		- removelock: Removes a stray lock file if one gets left behind
	- The command line would be: /etc/init.d/cumulusmx.sh start|stop|restart|status|removelock
	- Script name: \MXutils\linux\cumulusmx.sh
- New feature:
	- When running on Windows as a service, the service will stop if the computer goes to standby/hibernate mode. A script to set up
		a Scheduled Task that will restart the service on resume from standby/hibernate is provided in the \MXutils\windows folder.
		The script MUST be run with Administrator privileges.
	- Script name: \MXutils\windows\CreateCmxResumeFromStandbyTask.ps1
- Adds a new web tags for the Davis WLL device.
	<#ConsoleSupplyV>   - The WLL external supply voltage
	<#MulticastBadCnt>  - Count of multicast packets missed or have bad a CRC
	<#MulticastGoodCnt> - Count of good multicast packets received
	<#MulticastGoodPct> - Percentage of good multicast packets received
- On new installs of Cumulus MX, changes the default value of "WarnMultiple" from false to true
- Adds a download history limit of 50 bad packets for WMR200 station types. Previously it could get stuck in a loop downloading bad data.
- Adds Show UV-I to the graph hide/show options
- Updates ExportMySQL to include the new Humidex values from b3089
- AWEKAS uploads updated to API v4 - now can include indoor data, soil temp/moisture 1-4, and leaf wetness 1-2. And it supports rapid
	updates - minimum 15 seconds if you have a Stationsweb subscription, min 60 secs for Pro accounts, and 300 seconds for normal accounts
	- IMPORTANT NOTE: THe AWEKAS interval has changed from being set in minutes, to being set in seconds.
	  You MUST update the AWEKAS interval in the Internet settings/Cumulus.ini file to reflect this change.
	- New Cumulus.ini entries
		[Awekas]
		Language=en
		SendIndoor=0
		SendSoilMoisture=0
		SendLeafWetness=0
- Enabling/disabling and changing intervals for Twitter, WUnderground, Windy, PWS Weather, WOW, APRS, AWEKAS, Weather Cloud, MQTT from
  Internet Settings now takes immediate effect and does not require a Cumulus restart.

	- You can now do things like...
		<#TapptempH format="dd'&nbsp;'MMM'&nbsp;'yyyy'<span class=\'xx\'> at 'HH:mm'</span>'">
		which gives...
		04&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;2018<span class='xx'> at 10:12</span>

		Note: that you have to use single quotes for HTML entity names, and they have to be escaped "\'"

- New Davis Baud Rate setting
	- Allows you to alter the speed of the serial connection to Davis loggers
	- Configured manually in Cumulus.ini [Station] section
		DavisBaudRate=19200 (default) Permitted values are 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200

- Added new option for the "Extra files" - End of Day

	- There is a new Cumulus.ini file setting for each "extra" file associated with this setting
		ExtraEOD[nn]
	- Note there is currently no check between Realtime and End of Day settings, you could check both options and the file
	  will be processed at both the realtime interval AND end of day - which would not make much sense!

- Improvement to Instromet logger protocol handling

- Change the Fine Offset Synchronised Reads option to default to enabled

- Change VP2 automatic disabling of LOOP2 to an advisory message, as the firmware version is not always detected.

- Consistency: All record Value tags should now return '---' and Date tags '----' until they are first set.

	- Cumulus.ini
		[Offsets]
		HumMult2=0.0

- FTP Updates
	- Now supports FTPS over TLS1.1 and 1.2
	- In Passive FTP, you can disable Enhanced Passive (EPSV) mode if it causes problems with your host. Some hosts are reporting they support it, but a firewall along the route cannot handle the connections.
	  Requires manually adding a new Cumulus.ini entry...
		[FTP site]
		DisableEPSV=1
	- RealtimeGaugesTxt is no longer automatically enabled for FTP.

- Web Sockets are no longer on a separate port, it shares the same port as HTTP.
	- The wsport command line switch is still recognised for backwards compatibility, but it is no longer used.

- Fix Fine Offset with solar logger reading, now limited to the reduced number of logger entries available on solar stations.

- Fix for Slovenian locale (and any other with a two character date separator)



3044
————
- Added new solar calculation method "Bras"
	- New Cumulus.ini entries...
		SolarCalc=0    		(0=Ryan-Stolzenbach, 1=Bras, default=0)
		BrasTurbidity=2   	(atmospheric turbidity factor (2=clear, 5=smoggy, default=2)
	- Updated the Interface web files to reflect the new settings.

- Updated HidSharp to ver 2.0.5
	- Now uses libudev1 for Fine Offset and WMR200 stations

- Attempt to reconnect to Davis IP logger on connection failure (only a possible fix)

- Updated the default forum URL to it's new home

- Updated included website files to new URL

- URL encode Twitter messages (I know Twitter is largely broken)

- Davis VP2 - (Steve Loft) Added sanity checks for invalid wind speed/direction values

- Davis VP2 - Added automatic disabling of the use of LOOP2 packets on firmware versions < 1.90

- Change RG11 devices to use a new Cumulus.ini file entry. The previous MX builds would not work on Linux.
  For example:
	RG11port=2   (depreciated)
	RG11port2=3
		now use
	RG11portName=COM2   (for Windows or /dev/ttyUSB2 for Linux)
	RG11portName2=COM3   (for Windows or /dev/ttyUSB3 for Linux)

- The default Comm port values are now set to either COM1 or /dev/ttyUSB0 depending on the platform. Hopefully this will prevent some of the confusion of new users.
